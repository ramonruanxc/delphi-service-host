{
  ConcurrentPool — a worker that owns its thread.

  This unit exists to remove five hazards that a bare TThread hands you, each of
  which is a bug people actually ship.

  1. NO THREAD UNTIL Start. `TThread.Create(True)` followed by a destroy — the
     never-started suspended thread — is a classic hang or leak depending on the
     RTL version. Here Create allocates nothing but fields, so destroying a
     worker that was never started has nothing to wait on and nothing to free.

  2. Destroy JOINS, unconditionally. Execute reads FRunnable, FSource and FLock;
     abandoning a live thread and then freeing the worker is a use-after-free,
     and TerminateThread leaks whatever locks the thread held and can strand the
     heap lock. So cancellation is cooperative, a runnable that never checks its
     token cannot be stopped, and Destroy blocks until Run returns. WaitFor with
     a timeout exists so a CALLER can decide what to do about a slow worker; a
     destructor is not offered that choice. Blocking in a destructor is the
     lesser evil against freeing memory a running thread is reading.

  3. SELF-JOIN RAISES. Calling WaitFor from inside the worker's own Run would
     wait forever. EPoolSelfJoin says so instead, because a hang gives you no
     stack, no message, and burns a CI runner until the job times out.

  4. FAULTS ARE CAPTURED, not swallowed. An exception that escapes Execute lands
     in TThread.FatalException, where nothing ever reads it: the thread simply
     "ends" and the work silently disappears. Execute catches it and records the
     class name and message. The bare `else` matters — `on E: Exception` does
     not catch `raise TObject.Create` (measured on both compilers), and letting
     that escape would be a lost failure in a library whose pitch is that it
     does not lose failures.

  5. THE THREAD IS NEVER EXPOSED. No Handle, no Priority, no Suspend, no Resume.
     Re-publishing the footguns this unit exists to remove would undo the point.
